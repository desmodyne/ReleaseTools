  # TODO: this exposes the ansible private gitlab token; do this differently,
  # e.g. using a GitLab version of brew GitHub support: see e.g.

  # NOTE: installation / download can be tested using local formula using e.g.
  #   GITLAB_HOMEBREW_TOKEN=<snip> brew install --build-from-source ...
  #     ... <path to repo root>/HomebrewTools/Formula/release-tools.rb
  # https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/issues/1468
  # UPDATE: the above does not work, env var is not picked up in brew formula;
  # tested this thoroughly, the Ruby code as such is good, but still won;t work
  #
  # as an alternative, implement GitLabPrivateRepositoryDownloadStrategy
  # following GitHub example:
